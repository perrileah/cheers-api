# Cheers! API

Cheers! is an app that allows users to find, check-in and rank craft breweries. As a craft beer lover and manager at a brewery myself, I wanted to create an app similar to Untappd, the popular beer-ranking platform, but specific to breweries. I had a lot of fun creating this application while learning new web dev technologies and techniques.

Technologies used:

- Ruby on Rails backend
- PostgreSQL database seeded from Open Brewery DB external API using rest-client gem
- Mapbox external API for brewery geocoding
- API authentication using bcrypt gem file and jwt storage
- React.js frontend
- Bootstrap

# Minimum Viable Product

- Allow users to see all breweries (complete)
- Allow users to see individual breweries (complete)
- Allow users to create, update and destroy a brewery (complete)
- Allow users to see all checkins (complete)
- Allow users to see individual checkins (complete)
- Allow users to create, update and destroy a checkin (complete)
- Allow users to sign up (complete)
- Allow users to login and logout

# Additional Features

- Mapbox external API for brewery geocoding
- Star rating functionality for checkins
- A user can filter breweries by city, state or zip code
- A user can search for breweries by city, state or zip code
- An admin can create categories for type of brewery
- Facebook sharing integration
- Tests
